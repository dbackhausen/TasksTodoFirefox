      <h2><a name="abstract"></a>Abstract</h2>
      <p>The TasksTodo addon is an academic prototype that allows you to manage your goals and tasks at hand and to support you at your task-related information search activities on the web.</p>
      
      <h2><a name="background"></a>Background</h2>
      <p>Projects with a complex goal like writing a funding proposal, making decisions, or restoring classic cars, can take hours, days, or even months to complete. In such cases, information gathering requires more than just a single search session. To achieve such a goal, it is necessary to specify, execute, and complete derived tasks, since they define concretely what has to be done. In addition, executing a task requires a particular knowledge. For routine tasks, this knowledge normally exists, but if the task has a certain degree of complexity, the required knowledge is not available and the person will be in a problem situation. This situation will lead to information seeking in several information sources. During the different task stages, the knowledge requirements vary and change from the more general to the more specific. Both, the stage and the complexity of a task influence how we seek and search for information.</p><br/>
      <p>Our current research activities tackle this challenge by proposing new concepts that focus on multiple goals and simultaneously executed complex work tasks in which the information search is done using the web browser [2]. With the support of an integrated task tool, we enable users to structure their goals at hand into tasks and sub-tasks without leaving the browser or switching the application. Implicit (e.g. executed queries or visited web pages) and explicit (e.g. bookmarks) interactions are stored with reference to the current task in order to offer an organized task-based history that eases task resumption. Additionally, this data is used to build higher-level support features, like the adaption and personalization of the retrieved web content, or to provide modified support functionalities that match the task-related relevance.</p><br/>
      <p>TasksTodo allows users to easily create an arbitrary number of goals. Within each goal any number of tasks can be defined and structured on different levels (i.e., a task that contains sub-tasks). The integrated activity tracking, is implemented as an extensive logging mechanism that records all user operations and assigns this data to the current task. This log data contains the use of the prototype itself (i.e., how goals and tasks are managed), as well as the activities done in the browser (e.g., page visits or executed search queries). For instance, a page visit is logged in the form of a screenshot, the page title, the URL, and the content. Search activities are tracked, including the information about the search provider and the query. This way all behavioral data is stored implicitly in relation to the current goal and task, which allows us to present a task-based browsing history that provides an overview of past task-based activities in order to re-capture and continue interrupted tasks more easily.</p>
      
      <h2><a name="data-privacy"></a>Data Privacy</h2>
      <p>Data privacy plays an import role to us. Therefore, all the collected data is stored locally in the profile directory of your browser. This means that no data is submitted to anyone else. Moreover, you also have full control about which data is stored. If you remove certain entries, these information is deleted permanently from the local database.</p>

      <h2><a name="navigation"></a>Navigation</h2>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <p>Navigation is mainly done by clicking on goals or tasks. Goals can contain an arbitary number of tasks. From the tasks you can navigate back to the goals using the top navigation menu.</p>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <p>Goals are the first important concept of TasksTodo. They are an abstract definition of what has to be achived. Examples of a goal are writing a proposal, learning a new technology, but also building a house, or buying a hybrid car. Goals can group an arbitary number of tasks that define how this goal is achieved.</p>
          <p>You can create a new goal by clicking on the button "New goal". This opens a small text editor which allows you to define the title of your new goal. Store it by clicking on "Save".</p>

          <p>You can easily bookmark web pages to your current task (precondition is the selection of a task). Just open the context menu of the browser on the web page (not on a link) and select the option "Add this page as a bookmark to my current task" as shown in the screenshot to the right.</p>

          <p>TasksTodo stores the browsing history when you work on your tasks. Therefore it is necessary that you select a task in your task list. TasksTodo than automatically saves all visited web pages to the tasks' history. This can be helpful when working on longitudinal tasks, which last over different sessions. In these situations it allows you to easily recap your last session(s). You can access the history clicking on the history icon of a selected task.</p>

          <h3><a name="attach-files-by-upload"></a>Attach files by upload</h3>  
          <p>You can easily add files as an attachment to your tasks. Each task has its own file repository where you can add files to. To do so you have to select a task and click on the attachments icon. Then simply select your files on your local machine and drag them to the drag point. The upload begins and the files will appear in the attachments list.</p>

          <p>Another way to add attachments to your task is to save linked files. To do so open the context menu of the browser on a link, which links to the file as shown in the example in the left. This calls a function on the server to download this file for you and to store it as an attachment to your task.</p>
