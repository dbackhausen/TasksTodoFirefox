      <h2><a name="summary"></a>Summary</h2>
      <p>This addon is an academic prototype called TasksTodo. It allows you to manage your goals and tasks at hand and to save and restore relevant web pages during the different web sessions. It also offers different task-related functions like showing past web search queries or query suggestions. That way it will hopefully support you at your task-related information search activities on the web.</p>
      
      <h2><a name="background"></a>Background</h2>
      <p>Projects with a complex goal like writing a funding proposal or learning a new and complex topic can take hours, days, or even months to complete. In such cases, information gathering requires more than just a single search session. To achieve such a goal, it is necessary to specify, execute, and complete derived tasks, since they define concretely what has to be done. During the different task stages, the knowledge requirements vary and change from the more general to the more specific. Both, the stage and the complexity of a task influence how we seek and search for information.</p>
      <p>With the support of TasksTodo, we enable users to structure their goals at hand into tasks and sub-tasks without leaving the browser or switching the application. Implicit (e.g., executed queries or visited web pages) and explicit (e.g., bookmarks) interactions are stored with reference to the current task in order to offer an organized task-based history that eases task resumption. Additionally, this data is used to build higher-level support features, like the adaption and personalization of the retrieved web content, or to provide modified support functionalities that match the task-related relevance. To help users better recapture past activities, TasksTodo shows past web search queries. Moreover, it also shows suggestions regarding the current search query.</p>
      <p>TasksTodo allows users to easily create an arbitrary number of goals. Within each goal any number of tasks can be defined and structured on different levels (i.e., a task that contains sub-tasks). The integrated activity tracking, is implemented as an extensive logging mechanism that records all user operations and assigns this data to the current task. This log data contains the use of the prototype itself (i.e., how goals and tasks are managed), as well as the activities done in the browser (e.g., page visits or executed search queries). For instance, a page visit is logged in the form of a screenshot, the page title, the URL, and the content. Search activities are tracked, including the information about the search provider and the query. This way all behavioral data is stored implicitly in relation to the current goal and task, which allows us to present a task-based browsing history that provides an overview of past task-based activities in order to re-capture and continue interrupted tasks more easily.</p>
      
      <h2><a name="data-privacy"></a>Data Privacy</h2>
      <p>Data privacy is crucial. Therefore, data is stored in the local profile directory of your browser and is in control of the user. If the user delete entries from the task-related history, these data is physically deleted from the database. Form inputs like credentials are not stored. To offer support services like suggestions, data is used and anonymously sent to third party providers.</p>
